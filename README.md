# CamControl
Laser coupled microscopy system based on OpenCV

Based on Debian architecture build with CodeBlocks using wx. Requires OpenCV, libv4l2, videodev2, ioctl. Folder for saving images is implements static. To change directories you have to alter the regarding entries in the code.
The software serves as a capturing system for the MÃ¼ller-Wedel surgical microscope with 3 cameras attached. Acquisition happens via 4 channel PCI video card with a techwell 6805 single chip. The software refers to the cameras by enumeration from 1 to 3, where camera 1 (left) represents a CCD camera with no additional filtersystem. This is generally considered as a reference. CCD
camera 2 (middle) has a pre-installed filter designed for detecting fluorescence of pTurbo (ex 588/em 633) but requires additonal setting for excitation filter (behind microscope head, filter no. 1). CCD camera 3 (right) is equiped with a IR filter and highly sensitive to IR light, suitable for ICG. This camera requires excitation filter 2 to prevent overexposure.
